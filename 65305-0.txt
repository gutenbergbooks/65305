    [Illustration: Gift wraps]

_Front row, left to right_:

GIFT WRAP GROOMING. Package beauty begins when “Scotch” Cellophane Tape
holds paper securely in place.

STAY-PRETTY WRAP. It still looks pretty when box is opened. Just cover
lid and base separately. Cut paper to cover lid, plus 1 inch extra on
each side. Fold edges inside lid and fasten with tape (a). Cover base
same as lid. Idea shown: Arrange thin paper strips in “x’s” on table.
Press lengths of tape over “x’s” to pick them up and tape to box.

    [Illustration: a]

PICTURAMA. Child’s play. Use magazine scenes for gift paper. For larger
boxes, tape two or more pictures together.

SPARKLING SYMMETRY. Lovely! Wrap 3 loops of tape, sticky side out,
around a length of cardboard; space evenly (b). Place on box and press
down loops; slip out cardboard (c). Repeat, alternating direction of
loops on package. Sprinkle with glitter for the finishing touch.

    [Illustration: b]

    [Illustration: c]

_Back row, left to right_:

CHECKERBOARD. Imaginative! Tape down equal-sized squares of construction
paper to gift wrap. Make small loops of tape, sticky side out (d) and
place on box. Press wrapped Christmas candies to tape loops.

    [Illustration: d]

MONEY TREE. Attach new pennies to gift wrap with tape loops (d above) in
rows as shown. For extra glamor between pennies, fold back ends on
lengths of tape (e) and press, sticky side out, to box. Sprinkle with
glitter.

    [Illustration: e]

SNOWFLAKE DAZZLER. So sparkly! Cut 2 snowflake shapes from gift wrap
paper. Use first for package center; cut second into four equal parts
for corners (f). Back up openings with cellophane tape and sprinkle with
glitter. Attach to box with tape loops (d above).

    [Illustration: f]




   _Gift wrap glamor at a touch with the color of “Scotch” brand Gift
                                 Tapes_




    [Illustration: _Gay-as-the-season effects come easy with
    happy-looking “Scotch” Gift Tapes—in many modern new patterns and
    solid tones. And these tape-touched gifts go through the mails with
    beauty unmarred._

    In lively patterns and colors ... 10¢ rolls, 25¢ and 39¢
    dispensers.]

    [Illustration: Tape effects]

_From left to right_:

SHIRT TALE. Lively, masculine! Make shirt outline with colorful gift
tape. Attach buttons with “Scotch” Cellophane Tape (a). Add a “Sasheen”
bow tie.

    [Illustration: a]

“FUN UNLIMITED” TRAIN. Pure whimsey! Bright gift tape outlines train.
For button “wheels” and “eyes,” make plain tape loops, sticky side out
(b). Place loops on package; firmly press buttons to loops. Tape on gift
paper cylinders for “nose” and smokestack, add a puff of cotton for
smoke.

    [Illustration: b]

DIAMOND GLITTER. Eye-stopping! Wind gift tape, sticky side out, around
ruler (c). Place ruler on box; press down “spiral” securely. Ease out
ruler (d). Make another “spiral” and place beside first on package.
Sprinkle with glitter.

    [Illustration: c]

    [Illustration: d]

DOUBLE-TAKE TAPE. Top each length of tape with a narrow width in
contrasting color. Only the magic of gift tape permits such
“stop-and-start” designs!

NAME DROPPER. No mistaking gifts when you spell out names in gift tape
(e). _Tip_: For extra ease, form letters first on any glass surface;
lift all and place on box.

    [Illustration: e]

MERRY MAKINGS. Sign of the season! Center “Scotch” Brand “Merry
Christmas” Tape on box. Frame with smart solid tone tape for tailored
elegance.




    _The festive “Magic Bow” ... yours and only yours with “Sasheen”
                             brand Ribbon_


_None so fair, none so foolproof as the one and only “Magic Bow”._

_Let it be the basis for beauty of all your be-ribboned holiday gift
wraps._


                        “MAGIC BOW” INSTRUCTIONS

To use later as “tie” ribbon, cut off 8″ length of “Sasheen.” Tear in
half lengthwise.


                             PRE-FAB STAGE:

    [Illustration: a]

(a) Cut 2 to 3 yards of ribbon, depending on size of bow you wish. Form
a circle and tape end in place. Roll up ribbon.

    [Illustration: b]

(b) Press circle together and fold in half. Start from outside edge and
cut off corners, leaving ⅛″ center.

    [Illustration: c]

(c) Using “tie” ribbon, knot securely at center notch.


                      COMPLETING THE “MAGIC BOW”:

    [Illustration: d]

(d) Pull out _inside_ loop to left, then down and across center notch
with twist.

    [Illustration: e]

(e) Repeat this action, pulling out next inside loop to _right_.

    [Illustration: f]

(f) Continue alternating loops until all are pulled out at both ends.

    [Illustration: Magic bow effects]

_Left row, top to bottom_:

(Just a few of the lovely effects possible with “Magic Bows”.)

FRANKLY FEMININE. _Christmas Stripe_ “Decorette” brand Ribbon makes this
lacy and lovely “Magic Bow”.

BOWS APLENTY. A pair of contrasting “Magic Bows” on _Bows_ wrapping
paper.

BERRY BRIGHT. Large red “Magic Bow” of “Sasheen” Ribbon. For extra
elegance, tape holly sprigs or pine under bow.

_Right row, top to bottom_:

FROSTY SNOWMAN. Three “Magic Bows” form snowman. For hat, nose and eyes,
tape paper shapes to bow.

SUITCASE CHARMER. For handle, tape length of “Sasheen” to banding
ribbon. Add a pair of pert “Magic Bows”.

TWIN TRIM. Candy-striped “Magic Bow” teams with matching paper, aglow
with snowmen.




    [Illustration: Ask for the “Magic Bow” ribbons—instructions on every
    roll.]




 _Only the “Magic Bow” way lets you make these scissor-snip variations_




    [Illustration: _Gift wraps to make eyes dance—and all stemming from
    the basic “Magic Bow”. Only “Sasheen” brand Ribbon, with its special
    backing, makes possible these ingenious variations._

    Beauty team: “Sasheen” & color-matched gift papers]

    [Illustration: Magic bow variations]

_Front row, left to right_:

FROU-FROU BOW. Pert, frilly! Make a pre-fab “Magic Bow”. Cut from outer
edge, crossing over ends of loops (a). Repeat at opposite end. Pull out
loops as in “Magic Bow”.

    [Illustration: a]

SHOOTING STAR BOW. A two-tone beauty! Make the pre-fab “Magic Bow”,
starting by rolling together equal lengths of “Sasheen” in contrasting
colors. Make angle cuts at each end (b). Pull out loops as in “Magic
Bow”.

    [Illustration: b]

PINWHEEL BOW. A whirl of color here in lacy “Decorette.” Tie a pre-fab
“Magic Bow” making only 6 or 7 turns for loop. Pull out all loops to
_one_ side (not left and right) and arrange (c).

    [Illustration: c]

_Back row, left to right_:

PETITE WREATH. Make Petite Bows the “Magic Bow” way with _1 yard_ of
“Sasheen”. Use “tie” ribbon of contrasting color and knot to show. Tape
bows to box.

POINSETTIA BOW. A crush-proof traveler. With _1 yard_ of “Sasheen”, make
pre-fab “Magic Bow”. For petals, make cuts from outer edges toward loop
end (d). Pull out bottom petals from left to right, twisting so shiny
sides are up. Arrange top petals same way—no twisting needed. Nice
touch: Tape ribbon pennants or leaves under bows.

    [Illustration: d]

TWO-IN-ONE BOW. Make pre-fab “Magic Bow” using _off-center_ cut (e).
Pull out long loops first and arrange in outer circle. Pull out shorter
loops for a bow-within-a-bow the easy way!

    [Illustration: e]

    [Illustration: table centerpiece and window]

TABLE SPLENDOR. Trim net-covered tablecloth with gift tape. For
centerpiece, tape goblet to cake plate. Set hurricane chimney or glass
vase on plate (a) and fill with tree balls. For tree outline, run gift
tape from chimney top to the plate edge.

    [Illustration: a]

CATHEDRAL WINDOW. Let your imagination be your guide! Use crayon to draw
design. (Try tree shapes, holiday “scenes”, greetings.) For idea shown,
tape on triangles of colored cellophane. Then outline your design with
gift tape.




               _Set the scene for fun with gay gift tape_




    [Illustration: _All through your house a festive air will reign when
    you let the holiday color of “Scotch” brand Gift Tape brighten
    decorations, household objects. In colors, patterns, gleaming
    metallics—gift tape has gone glamorous!_

    Treat yourself to a selection of widths and colors—10¢, 25¢, 39¢.]

    their own cards. Needed: scissors, paper, lots of bright “Scotch”
    Gift Tape—and observe the lively results!]

    [Illustration: CHRISTMAS EVERYWHERE. Let your imagination run riot!
    Use gay gift tape for a happy note on your wastebaskets, bulletin
    boards, mirrors, flowerpots, match books.]

cards with the Christmas Magic touch of “Scotch” brand Cellophane Tape._

    [Illustration: FRIENDSHIP WREATH. Simply tape Christmas cards to a
    “hula hoop” for dramatic wall decoration! (b).]

    [Illustration: b]

    [Illustration: “FRIENDSHIP GIFT” IDEA—NEW DÉCOR DISPENSER, 98¢.
    Attractive way to keep “Scotch” brand Cellophane Tape always at hand
    in kitchen, den or family room. Four home-décor colors—non-slip
    bottom for dispensing tape with one-hand ease—scratchproof
    rubber-padded base. Tape not included, so try this wrapping idea:
    Add a 59¢ economy-size roll (4 times the tape of a 25¢ roll) as the
    eye of a gay “Santa” face—plus ornament for eyeball, shaped paper
    for wink, cotton for beard. Wonderful gift for friends, neighbors—or
    as a party prize.]

    [Illustration: FRIENDSHIP TREE. Loop a length of tape around branch
    and fasten to Christmas card (a). Cards taped to mantel or mirror
    add a bright air, too! Note: Never use tape on wallpaper or painted
    walls.

    GLITTER WANDS. For tree, mantel, staircase. Cut tape in varying
    lengths. Sprinkle with glitter, leaving a “bare” space at both ends.

    [Illustration: GIFT TAGS. A great new idea! “Scotch” brand Gift
    Tapes you can write on—plus bright stickers. 10 on a roll. Just snip
    them off and press down for new labeling speed and ease.]

    [Illustration: IDENTIFY GIFT GIVERS. End “thank you” note mix-ups.

    gifts: use it to attach givers’ names to packages (or to gifts) as
    they’re opened.]

    [Illustration: STOCKING STUFFER. Drop several rolls of “Scotch”
    Cellophane Tape ... or leftover rolls of Gift Tape ... in the
    youngsters’ Christmas stockings. Just watch them put the tape to
    creative use during many play time hours.]

    [Illustration: DAZZLE WREATH. Front-door dress-up with Glitter Bows
    (or any “Sasheen” bow). Make “Magic Bows”. Then press loop ends
    together (a) and cut V-notches in as many loops as you like. Back

    Form a wire coat hanger into a circle and tape or tie on bows.]

    [Illustration: a]

    [Illustration: CHRISTMAS STORY ON TAPE. The holiday classic, “’Twas
    the Night Before Christmas”, re-told and pictured on a roll of
    “Scotch” Gift Tape. Fun to tell from start to finish on children’s
    gift wraps or Christmas cards.]

    [Illustration: CENTERPIECE CAKE. Focal point of your festive holiday
    table ... this gay cake with Fluffy White Frosting. Make 2 “Magic

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
